<p>A jobslog sheet system I created for the jobcentre and/or interserve working futures. Utilises PHP/MySQL.</p>

<p>This is a jobs record website, it allows for you (the user) to have an online record of your job-hunting.</p>

<p>Allows for the input of Jobs using ID and other additional details.</p>

<p>In the future this will be updated with more functions but as at this present time (10/06/2013) all core functions have been created and implemented.</p>

<p>Current issues to be addressed:</p>

<p>User sessions security (thinking of changing to session_set_save_handler
Commit: 10/06/2013, have implemented a secure hashing alogorithm to secure site passwords.
Need to add new setting once user logged-in
All pages have been completed thus far
Sanitisation of code
Done 3.To add: Mysql Database.
Still to do.
Implemented a secure hashing alogrithm to check user session data, once user logged-in elsewhere session will be destroyed.
Implemented site events, such as user adding new jobslog as well as the sending of email.
Implemented registration and new login forms.</p>

<p>13/06/2013 Implemented more user friendly date picker for 'addjob' page.
15/06/2013 Implemented a small admin backend, updated navigation files.
This is my final release for now, in the near future I will be releasing the database which powers this website.</p>
